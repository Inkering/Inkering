### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

/////////////

I'm Dieter, I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I make art with code and code with art, along with other visual explorations. Most of the interesting stuff is on [dieterbrehm.com](http://dieterbrehm.com), but on here you can find:

* weird experimental websites
* scheduling utilities
* latex templates
* and more! ðŸŒ±
